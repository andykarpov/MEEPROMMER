MEEPROMMER
==========

(E)EPROM programmer based on Arduino hardware

The MEEPROMMER is a combination of hardware and software that lets you read and write 
data from (and to) 28C256, 28C128, 28C64, 28C16 EEPROMS.

The Arduino firmware provides a serial interface with simple commands to transfer data 
between a host computer and an eeprom.

For the host computer a Java based GUI application is available that uses the RXTX 
library to interface the programmer.
